Upgrade both.\n* **Incantations:**  Focus on buffs (Golden Vow) and healing (Incantations are less important early).\n* **Playstyle:**  Learn to stagger enemies with heavy attacks, use incantations for support.\n\nThis build is forgiving of mistakes, offers good damage and survivability.  Focus on upgrading your weapon first.",

    "feedback":"The AI response is excellent and provides a well-structured build suggestion.  It successfully addresses the request for a beginner-friendly build.  To reach full completeness, it could mention armor type (medium) and flask charges, as the reference answer does.  The inclusion of Faith is a reasonable addition, offering a slightly more nuanced suggestion for beginners."

    "ai_answer":"- **Vigor:** Prioritize Vigor to increase your health pool.  Early game hits can be devastating, and having enough health to survive mistakes is crucial.\n\n- **Endurance:**  A decent amount of Endurance is helpful for stamina management, especially if using heavier weapons.\n\n- **Strength or Dexterity:** Choose one based on your preferred weapon type.  Strength scales with heavier weapons like Greatswords and Hammers, while Dexterity scales with faster, lighter weapons like Katanas and Rapiers.\n\n- **Starting Weapon:** Choose a weapon that aligns with your chosen Strength\/Dexterity focus.  A Greatsword (Strength) or Uchigatana (Dexterity) are good starting points.\n\n- **Leveling Strategy:** Focus on Vigor and your chosen damage stat (Strength or Dexterity) initially.  Once you have a good base, you can start investing in other stats as needed (like Endurance).\n\n- **Early Game Focus:** Explore the starting area thoroughly.  Learn enemy attack patterns, and don't be afraid to run away and heal.  Upgrade your weapons at the nearest smithing stone locations.  Use your flasks liberally.",
